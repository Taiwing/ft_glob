# ft\_glob

Implementation of the *fnmatch* and *glob* functions in C. This exists as a
module for the 42sh project.

## Setup

```shell
# clone this repo
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Taiwing/ft_glob.git
# build it
cd ft_glob/ && make
```

## Development

This project sources contains two subdirectories, fnmatch/ and glob/ which
hold the implementation of their corresponding functions. By default this
project will compile a program to test these functions.
